# State: Redux Store

## My Project

I am to refactor an e-commerce platform so that it uses [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

## User Story

```md
AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state
WHEN I review the appâ€™s store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
```

## Mock-Up

This section reviews the web application's appearance and functionality.

The following animation shows how a user can register using the Signup page and then navigate to the Products page:

![A user registers on the Signup page and then navigates to the Products page, which displays images and descriptions of products.](./Assets/22-state-homework-demo-01.gif)

The following animation shows how the user can select a category, choose a product, view details about it on the product page, and add and remove it from their shopping cart:

![The user selects a category, chooses a product, views details about it on the product page, and adds it to and removes it from their shopping cart.](./Assets/22-state-homework-demo-02.gif)

Finally, the user can check out by going to their shopping cart, as shown in the following animation:

## Notes

UPDATE: July 17, 2024: Re-visiting this project to fix the errors. 

July 22, 2024: Fixed most errors, but still works fine. 

Going on vacation for two weeks. Will work on this later. 

For instructions to add Redux to your application, refer to the [Redux Fundamentals basic tutorial](https://redux.js.org/basics/basic-tutorial).

I have used the Stripe API to process payments, which includes making front-end and back-end changes. Don't worry, Stripe provides test credentials, so you won't need to use a real credit card to try it out. Refer to the [Stripe docs on testing your integration](https://stripe.com/docs/testing).

**Important**: The project requires a specific version `(>=7.0)` of `npm` in order to install peer dependencies like GraphQL when deploying to Heroku. By default, Heroku uses `npm 6.x`, which may cause some issues. Be sure to refer to the [Heroku Docs on Specifying an NPM Version](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs-support#specifying-an-npm-version) to ensure your `package.json` file is set up correctly, as shown in the following snippet:

  ```json
  {
    "engines": {
      "npm": "7.x"
    }
  }
  ```

## Installation

```npm install```

```npm run develop```
